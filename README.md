#  Spacio : PVC-Auditor

**pvc-auditor** is an **open-source Kubernetes CLI and agent** that helps teams **find and understand PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) waste** in their clusters.

Kubernetes makes it easy to allocate storage, but hard to track how much is actually used. Over time, this leads to:

- PVCs that are over-provisioned (e.g. 500 Gi allocated, only 20 Gi used)

- PVCs that are unused or orphaned (left behind after workload deletion)

- PVCs that are expensive to maintain across cloud providers

For platform teams, **this creates hidden costs, wasted resources, and operational risk.**

**pvc-auditor solves this problem by auditing your clusterâ€™s PVCs and generating detailed reports:**

- CLI reports for automation pipelines

- JSON/YAML outputs for GitOps and integrations

- Rich HTML dashboards for engineers and managers to review

The result: **clear visibility into storage usage, waste, and savings potential.**

### Why PVC-Auditor?

- **Visibility first** â†’ know what storage is allocated vs. actually used

- **Safe by design**  â†’ auditing only, no risky shrinking logic in the OSS CLI

- **Cloud agnostic** â†’ works on AWS EBS, GCP PD, Azure Disk, and any CSI driver

- **Contributor-friendly** â†’ simple Go/Python codebase, great for students & OSS devs

- **Path to automation** â†’ upgrade to the SaaS edition for shrinking, policies, and multi-cluster support

### How It Fits

âœ… **Open Source** (this repo): Single-cluster audits, reports, developer contributions

ðŸ”’ **Enterprise SaaS**: Multi-cluster management, automated shrinking, approvals, RBAC, dashboards

Think of **pvc-auditor** as your first step toward **cost-aware Kubernetes storage management.**
Audit today. Shrink tomorrow. ðŸš€
