2. By submitting contributions, you agree to the Contributor License Agreement (CLA.md).
3. Contributions will be licensed under the Apache 2.0 License (see LICENSE).

## Steps
- Fork the repository
- Create a feature branch

- Submit a Pull Request


## ðŸ›  Local Development Setup
### Prerequisites
- Go 1.21+
- Docker & kind/minikube (for local cluster testing)

### Getting Started

* Fork the repository and clone it locally:

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/spacio-k8s/PVCAuditor.git
  cd pvc-audit
  
  # Build CLI
  go mod tidy
   go build -o pvc-auditor main.go
   
  #Good to Run Auditor
  ./pvc-audit list 
  ```

###  Branching

* Always work on a feature branch (not `main`).
* Branch naming convention:

  * `feat/<feature-name>` â†’ for new features
  * `fix/<bug-name>` â†’ for bug fixes
  * `docs/<update>` â†’ for documentation changes
  * `chore/<update>` â†’ for cleanup, refactor, or dependency update

Example:
```bash
   git checkout -b feat/add-grafana-export
```


### Commit Messages

We use **conventional commits** to keep history clean:

* **feat:** â†’ new feature
* **fix:** â†’ bug fix
* **docs:** â†’ documentation only
* **refactor:** â†’ code change that doesnâ€™t add features/fixes bugs
* **test:** â†’ adding or updating tests
* **chore:** â†’ tooling, build, dependency updates

**Format:**

```
<type>(scope): short description
```

**Examples:**

* `feat(cli): add --all-namespaces flag to list command`
* `fix(audit): correct calculation of wastage percentage`
* `docs: update usage examples in README`


## 4. Code Standards

* Follow Go best practices (`gofmt`, `golangci-lint`).
* Write modular, testable functions.
* Add **unit tests** for new logic where possible.
* Keep CLI help text and usage examples up to date.


### Testing Changes
